"""The Policy Sandbox - the deterministic "Bouncer".

This is the strict gate between the probabilistic conversational layer and any
real financial action. The orchestrator (and, upstream of it, the LLM) can only
*propose* an action; nothing reaches a channel adapter until this sandbox
approves it against a hardcoded merchant policy.

The point is airtight compliance: even a jailbroken or prompt-injected LLM
cannot give away an unapproved discount or use a disallowed channel, because the
decision here is pure data validation with no model in the loop.
