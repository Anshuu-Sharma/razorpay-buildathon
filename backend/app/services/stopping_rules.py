"""Deterministic stopping rules - the compliance guards.

These enforce the PRD/regulatory "when to stop" logic *outside* the LLM, so the
engine's adherence to opt-outs, disputes, RBI retry caps and TRAI time-gates
does not depend on a model behaving. The user-message screener in particular is
the adversarial defence: it scans for opt-out/cancel/dispute intent by literal
keyword, so an opt-out survives even when it is buried inside a prompt-injection
payload.
