"""Deterministic failure-class routing.

Classification is intentionally *not* delegated to the LLM. Razorpay hands us an
exact error/event signal, and the PRD locks a fixed trigger-code -> class table,
so routing is a pure dictionary lookup. This keeps the "which playbook" decision
100% reproducible and reserves the probabilistic layer (Gemini) for root-cause
nuance and Hinglish parsing, where it actually earns its keep.
